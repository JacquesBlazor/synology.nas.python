# synology.nas.python
This simple tool was made to automate the folder creating and image/urls downloading for your synology NAS.

You can refer to the .jpg screenshot for reference. 
To use it, you have to create a 'account' file under your ~/home/.nas/ folder either one your Windows or NAS/Linux depends on where you'd prefer to run it. 
And then you need to replace the url variable for what you'd like to download. 
The folder where the file to be downloaded will be automatically generated by the time when you run it but you can change it.
